## Project: **Finding Lane Lines on the Road** 
***
In this project, you will use the tools you learned about in the lesson to identify lane lines on the road.  You can develop your pipeline on a series of individual images, and later apply the result to a video stream (really just a series of images). Check out the video clip "raw-lines-example.mp4" (also contained in this repository) to see what the output should look like after using the helper functions below. 

Once you have a result that looks roughly like "raw-lines-example.mp4", you'll need to get creative and try to average and/or extrapolate the line segments you've detected to map out the full extent of the lane lines.  You can see an example of the result you're going for in the video "P1_example.mp4".  Ultimately, you would like to draw just one line for the left side of the lane, and one for the right.

In addition to implementing code, there is a brief writeup to complete. The writeup should be completed in a separate file, which can be either a markdown file or a pdf document. There is a [write up template](https://github.com/udacity/CarND-LaneLines-P1/blob/master/writeup_template.md) that can be used to guide the writing process. Completing both the code in the Ipython notebook and the writeup template will cover all of the [rubric points](https://review.udacity.com/#!/rubrics/322/view) for this project.

Let's have a look at our first image called 'test_images/solidWhiteRight.jpg'.  Run the 2 cells below (hit Shift-Enter or the "play" button above) to display the image.

**Note: If, at any point, you encounter frozen display windows or other confounding issues, you can always start again with a clean slate by going to the "Kernel" menu above and selecting "Restart & Clear Output".**

---

**The tools you have are color selection, region of interest selection, grayscaling, Gaussian smoothing, Canny Edge Detection and Hough Tranform line detection.  You  are also free to explore and try other techniques that were not presented in the lesson.  Your goal is piece together a pipeline to detect the line segments in the image, then average/extrapolate them and draw them onto the image for display (as below).  Once you have a working pipeline, try it out on the video stream below.**

**Run the cell below to import some packages.  If you get an `import error` for a package you've already installed, try changing your kernel (select the Kernel menu above --> Change Kernel).  Still have problems?  Try relaunching Jupyter Notebook from the terminal prompt.

## Ideas for Lane Detection Pipeline

**Some OpenCV functions (beyond those introduced in the lesson) that might be useful for this project are:**

`cv2.inRange()` for color selection  
`cv2.fillPoly()` for regions selection  
`cv2.line()` to draw lines on an image given endpoints  
`cv2.addWeighted()` to coadd / overlay two images
`cv2.cvtColor()` to grayscale or change color
`cv2.imwrite()` to output images to file  
`cv2.bitwise_and()` to apply a mask to an image

**Check out the OpenCV documentation to learn about these and discover even more awesome functionality!**

## Helper Functions

Below are some helper functions to help get you started. They should look familiar from the lesson!


```python
import math

def grayscale(img):
    """Applies the Grayscale transform
    This will return an image with only one color channel
    but NOTE: to see the returned image as grayscale
    (assuming your grayscaled image is called 'gray')
    you should call plt.imshow(gray, cmap='gray')"""
    return cv2.cvtColor(img, cv2.COLOR_RGB2GRAY)
    # Or use BGR2GRAY if you read an image with cv2.imread()
    # return cv2.cvtColor(img, cv2.COLOR_BGR2GRAY)
    
def canny(img, low_threshold, high_threshold):
    """Applies the Canny transform"""
    return cv2.Canny(img, low_threshold, high_threshold)

def gaussian_blur(img, kernel_size):
    """Applies a Gaussian Noise kernel"""
    return cv2.GaussianBlur(img, (kernel_size, kernel_size), 0)

def region_of_interest(img, vertices):
    """
    Applies an image mask.
    
    Only keeps the region of the image defined by the polygon
    formed from `vertices`. The rest of the image is set to black.
    """
    #defining a blank mask to start with
    mask = np.zeros_like(img)   
    
    #defining a 3 channel or 1 channel color to fill the mask with depending on the input image
    if len(img.shape) > 2:
        channel_count = img.shape[2]  # i.e. 3 or 4 depending on your image
        ignore_mask_color = (255,) * channel_count
    else:
        ignore_mask_color = 255
        
    #filling pixels inside the polygon defined by "vertices" with the fill color    
    cv2.fillPoly(mask, vertices, ignore_mask_color)
    
    #returning the image only where mask pixels are nonzero
    masked_image = cv2.bitwise_and(img, mask)
    return masked_image


def draw_lines(img, lines, color=[255, 0, 0], thickness=2):
    """
    NOTE: this is the function you might want to use as a starting point once you want to 
    average/extrapolate the line segments you detect to map out the full
    extent of the lane (going from the result shown in raw-lines-example.mp4
    to that shown in P1_example.mp4).  
    
    Think about things like separating line segments by their 
    slope ((y2-y1)/(x2-x1)) to decide which segments are part of the left
    line vs. the right line.  Then, you can average the position of each of 
    the lines and extrapolate to the top and bottom of the lane.
    
    This function draws `lines` with `color` and `thickness`.    
    Lines are drawn on the image inplace (mutates the image).
    If you want to make the lines semi-transparent, think about combining
    this function with the weighted_img() function below
    """
    for line in lines:
        for x1,y1,x2,y2 in line:
            cv2.line(img, (x1, y1), (x2, y2), color, thickness)

def hough_lines(img, rho, theta, threshold, min_line_len, max_line_gap):
    """
    `img` should be the output of a Canny transform.
        
    Returns an image with hough lines drawn.
    """
    lines = cv2.HoughLinesP(img, rho, theta, threshold, np.array([]), minLineLength=min_line_len, maxLineGap=max_line_gap)
    line_img = np.zeros((img.shape[0], img.shape[1], 3), dtype=np.uint8)
    draw_lines(line_img, lines)
    return line_img

# Python 3 has support for cool math symbols.
# def weighted_img(img, initial_img, α=0.8, β=1., λ=0.):
#     """
#     `img` is the output of the hough_lines(), An image with lines drawn on it.
#     Should be a blank image (all black) with lines drawn on it.
#     `initial_img` should be the image before any processing.
#     The result image is computed as follows:
#     initial_img * α + img * β + λ
#     NOTE: initial_img and img must be the same shape!
#     """
#     return cv2.addWeighted(initial_img, α, img, β, λ)



# but you can get around using python 2 
def weighted_img(img, initial_img, alpha=0.8, beta=1., lambda_=0.):
    """
    `img` is the output of the hough_lines(), An image with lines drawn on it.
    Should be a blank image (all black) with lines drawn on it.

    """
    return cv2.addWeighted(initial_img, alpha, img, beta, lambda_)
```

## Test Images

Build your pipeline to work on the images in the directory "test_images"  
**You should make sure your pipeline works well on these images before you try the videos.**


```python
# tuning params

files = os.listdir("test_images/")
#print(files)
for f in files:
    if not f.startswith("output") and not f.startswith("._"):
        print(f)
        img = mpimg.imread("test_images/" + f)
        gray = grayscale(img)
        gray = gaussian_blur(gray, 5)
        edges = canny(gray, 50, 150)
        
        imshape = img.shape
        x, y = imshape[1], imshape[0]
        vertices = np.array([[(0.51 * x, 0.6 * y),
                             (0.49 * x, 0.6 * y),
                             (10, y),
                             (x * 0.95, y)]],
                           dtype=np.int32)
        target = region_of_interest(edges, vertices)
        
        #img, rho, theta, threshold, min_line_len, max_line_gap
        lines = hough_lines(target, 2, np.pi/180, 15, 40, 20)
        
        result = weighted_img(lines, img, alpha=0.8, beta=1.0)
        
        #plt.imshow(result, cmap='gray')
        
        r, g, b = cv2.split(result)
        result = cv2.merge((b, g, r))
        
        cv2.imwrite("test_images/output_" + f, result)
        
```

## Lane Finding Pipeline



### Improved the draw_lines() function

#### A few important modifications:
    
    1. Identify the hough lines into right or left based on slope 
    2. Average the slope, center over all lines (left, right separately)
    3. From the Average slope and center, extrapolate the line using y coordinate of one known point 

## Writeup and Submission

If you're satisfied with your video outputs, it's time to make the report writeup in a pdf or markdown file. Once you have this Ipython notebook ready along with the writeup, it's time to submit for review! Here is a [link](https://github.com/udacity/CarND-LaneLines-P1/blob/master/writeup_template.md) to the writeup template file.


## Optional Challenge

Try your lane finding pipeline on the video below.  Does it still work?  Can you figure out a way to make it more robust?  If you're up for the challenge, modify your pipeline so it works with this video and submit it along with the rest of your project!
